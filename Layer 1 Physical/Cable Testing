# Overview
I will repair and Test an ethernet cables 

# Tools to use on linux:
1. ip link show: to show network interfaces and their states
2. ethtool (interface): to help me view or change hardware settings on ethernet interfaces
3. ping & traceroute: for basic connectivity testing at the physical level

# Steps I wil take physically:
1. Test cables using an enthernet tester 
2. RE crimped connectors using the t568 
3. I will verified connectivity with the command "ping"

## Steps Taken
1. Tested ethernet cable using an ethernet cable tester
2. Fixed ethernet cable re instaliing RJ45 connectors in the dammaged cables
3. Used "ip link show" to check network interfaces
4. checked ethernet speed using command " ethtool eth0" and configured settings for auto negotiation

### Results
