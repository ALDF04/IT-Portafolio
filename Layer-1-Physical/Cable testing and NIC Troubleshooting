# Proyect - Cable testing And Troubleshooting. the idea is learn how to test the cables, 
identify faults and learn the perfect way to fix them using the appropiate tools

# Overview
I will repair and Test an ethernet cables 

# Tools and commands to use on linux:
1. ip link show: to show network interfaces and their states
2. ethtool (interface): to help me view or change hardware settings on ethernet interfaces
3. ping & traceroute: for basic connectivity testing at the physical level
4. Sudo ip link set ethname up/down: bring the interface UP or Down: If an interface is down, you can bring it up with this commands

# Steps I wil take physically:
1. Test cables using an enthernet tester 
2. RE crimped connectors using the t568 
3. I will verified connectivity with the command "ping"

## Steps Taken
1. Tested ethernet cable using an ethernet cable tester
2. Fixed ethernet cable re instaliing RJ45 connectors in the dammaged cables
3. Used "ip link show" to check network interfaces
4. checked ethernet speed using command " ethtool eth0" and configured settings for auto negotiation

## Screenshoots:

## Automating NIC checks with a bash script
I wrote a simple bash script to automatically check the status of the network interfaces and display information using ip link and ethtool


### Results 
By fixing faulty cables and adjusting network interfaces on Linux, I ensured stable network connectivity


### Understanding resuls after command ip link show 
1. outputheaders: 1: lo: indicates the loopback interface (a virtual interface used for internal cominucation within the system)
1.1 2: enp7s0: this is the name of the ethernet network interface
1.2 3: wlp1350: this is the name of the wireless network interface (WI-FI)

2. Interface Status:
2.1 UP & DOWN: indicate whether the interface is active(UP) or inactive (DOWN)
2.2 UNKNOWN:Indicates that the interface is inactive, waiting to be activated

3. MAC Addresses:
3.1 link/ether (address): Displays the MAC address of the interface, whicj is a unique identifier for each network device
(00:00:00:00:00:00:00)(94:57:a5:06:9c:9b

4.MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):
4.1 mtu (1500/65536): the maximum size of packets that can be sent through that interface.

5. Additional Status: 
5.1: BROADCAST/MULTICAST: Indicate that the interface can send data to multiple recipients.
